# premierlangage

The "premier langage" project aims to provide an easy-to-use, automatically-corrected exercise platform.

## For Students

An intuitive and simple interface for exercises.
The possibility, for the student, to create a course reviewing path fitting his needs.

## For Teachers

We wish to simplify the life of the poor parents of online teaching platforms !!
Both the **maximal potential** : possibility to design new exercises types, and **super easy**, MCQ exercises, drag and drop, selection... that takes two minutes to write.


### A classroom leading interface

Statistiques and scores on the students and exercises.
Database and plug-ins with API to multiply the analysing means.
Keywords analyse, concepts, leaderboards, distributions, positioning...

### An exercise conception language

An exercise definition language, both very easy and complete, based on Python,
it is indeed possible to code with Python and JavaScript every ideas that we may have without losing the platform integration.

### A Sheet and classroom management language

#### Classrooms

According to your needs you can either :
- Work on a class, on which you wish to be able to indicate, to student groups, specific exercises (misunderstood units, simpler exercises, more motivating exercises).
- Organise your workgroups more easily.
- Organise group exercises (competitions, worksharing, projects, games).

#### Sheets

You have an exercises list, you want the student to complete it as fast as possible and that, in the end, they understand the importants units.
The student disparity means that some exercises are useful for some students and maybe not for some other students: the sheet descriptions language will allow you to "code" those differences.
