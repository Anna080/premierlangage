"""
23 Nov 2019, nborie : original first implementation

The spirit of this utility application is to provide a single API for other
Django application to get some statistics. This application should not have
responsability of displaying nicely the statistics. The purpose of the
application stats is to allow student, teacher, didactician


## STAT_ON_ALL_ANSWERS

Here is a first pattern of statistics request under all logs.

From all logs inside Answers of playexo activity :

### Step one : filtering by reducing the set of log

* user (RGPD : for teacher on their current student, for student on their own activity)
* pl
* grade
* seed
* date

### Step two : choosing counted object

* occurence (number of log)

### Step three : "in function of" or "partitionned by" choose an abscica param√®ter

* pl
* grade
* seed
* date

Such statistic request will return a Python list of tuple `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ]`
